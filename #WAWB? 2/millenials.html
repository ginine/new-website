<h4>WHY ARE MILLENIALS BROKE?</h4>
<h5><strong>Millenials can't sleep. Here's why.</strong></h5>

<div class="article-content">
  <p>The millennials landed on the job market at a miserable moment in economic history. On the upside, that should give us something to lord over our children when we’re middle-aged and cranky. On the downside, our poor timing will probably depress our incomes for some time to come, since graduating into a recession can drag down your earnings for years. 

One-third of New Yorkers between the ages of 23 and 29 have bachelor’s degrees but still work in low-wage jobs — 10 percent more than in 2000, city Comptroller Scott Stringer says in a new survey.</p>

  <p>The report, which compared the wages of 20-somethings in 2000 and 2014, found that the average income of young workers has plunged over that period.

In 2000, the average 23-year-old made $27,700 a year. By 2014, it was down to $23,500.

The income of the average 29-year-old also fell, from $56,000 to $50,300.
</p>

  <p>Young people working in arts and entertainment were hit the hardest, with their pay down 26 percent.

Those with jobs in food service, hospitality and retail were also forced to pinch pennies, as their wages dived 16 percent.

Stringer chalked up the depressing statistics to timing, saying many young people graduated from college just as the economy was collapsing.</p>

  <p>“Millennials were applying for jobs in the most difficult economic climate since the Great Depression and, as a result, a growing number are now working in low-wage industries and earning less than their predecessors,” Stringer said.
</p>

  <p>“This group of young people is confronting unique economic challenges that their parents did not have to face,” he added. “Every generation is expected to do better than the last, but too many millennials are not getting a fair chance to make it in New York City.”</p>

  <p>The report comes as the number of 20-somethings in New York skyrockets.

The percentage of the city’s population made up of that age bracket jumped from 10 to 19 percent between 2000 and 2014.</p>

  <p>A study last year by the Center for American Progress produced similar disheartening findings nationwide. The study found that 30-year-olds today make about as much as a 30-year-old would have earned in 1984, around $19.30 an hour.</p>

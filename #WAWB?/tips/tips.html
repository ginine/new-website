<h4>TIPS</h4>
<strong><h5>Want to stop being broke? here's how:</h5></strong>
<p>You seem to never have any money at the end of the month and always ask yourself, why am I broke? Here are 14 possible reasons why and how to fix them.

There is a difference between broke and poor. Poor means you don’t make enough to cover all of your necessities. Broke means you can cover the necessities but never have enough money to save or pay down debt. If the latter describes you, here are some reasons why you’re broke. Stop asking yourself why am I broke and start fixing the issues before they make you poor.

        <strong><h2>1. YOU'RE LAZY</h2></strong>
        <p>Well, stop being lazy! I know certain things are a pain but they won’t kill you. Being lazy in this way is a bad mind set and it will work against you when you’re trying to make good financial decisions.

Now I take out more money each ATM trip so I have to go less often. Cash doesn’t burn a hole in my pocket so having some extra around doesn’t mean I spend it more. I still spend it on only the things I need cash for.

Maybe part of the reason you send out laundry is because you let it pile up and it seems overwhelming to do it all at once. So don’t let it go for so long. Schedule it like you would anything that has to get done and do it!

        <strong><h1>2. YOUR SOCIALIZING IS EXPENSIVE
</h1></strong>
        <p> Cut back a little. You can decline an invitation once in awhile without alienating people. Offer to host a get together. Have a pot luck or just invite a few people over for pizza and beer. Neither option is free but both are bound to be cheaper than going out.

Try also to not make every outing revolve around food and drink. Meeting for dinner or at the bar are just kind of default options but spend a few minutes thinking of alternatives. Meet at a museum, the zoo, a walk in the park. If you do live in an urban area, search the web for free events in your city. There are pages of results if you do that for NYC. In October I’m going to a Renaissance Fair. It’s cheesy but fun and it only costs $1 to get in.

      <section id="mag3" data-magellan-target="mag3">
        <strong><h1>3. YOU'RE A BRAND SLAVE</h1></strong>
        <p> Only buy the brand name if there is an appreciable difference. Over the counter drugs are a good place to save by buying an off brand. Some store brands are markedly cheaper and the FDA requires them to be chemically identical to the name brands. The name brands are more expensive because of the research and development costs in making the product and the advertising money spent to promote them.

Sometimes the store brand is better anyway. Whole Foods’ brand of almond butter is cheaper than the name brands and has nothing in it but almonds while some of the name brands contain weird oils and various types of sugar they try to hide under one of its 57 different names.

      <section id="mag4" data-magellan-target="mag4">
        <STRONG><h1>4. YOU'RE PENNY WISE & POUND FOOLISH</h1></STRONG>
        <p>Look at the bigger picture. You did well to save on your grocery bill but it doesn’t give you a licence to be careless in other areas. Approach spending larger amounts the same way you approach spending small amounts.</p>
      </section>

            <section id="mag5" data-magellan-target="mag5">
        <STRONG><h1>5. YOU'RE POUND WISE & PENNY FOOLISH</h1></STRONG>
        <p>You might not even notice you do this because the amounts you’re spending this way are pretty small. Even if you do notice, you don’t think much of it again, because it’s only a few dollars at a time. But little things add up too. And they add up faster for broke ass people of which you are one.

Another reason these small amounts are easy to miss is because often times we use cash for them. It hardly seems worth getting out your credit card (which you probably are not paying in full every month) for $2.34 when you have a ten dollar bill in your wallet. So if you are tracking spending in Mint or something similar, those cash transactions aren’t showing up.

Give yourself a cash allowance for the week that you do track in your budget so you can see where it’s going. Once you know, you can be more mindful of how these small amounts are adding up.</p>

      <section id="mag6" data-magellan-target="mag6">
        <STRONG><h1>6. YOU'RE DISORGANIZED</h1></STRONG>
        <p>Life is more expensive when you’re disorganized. That duvet is in the house. It’s buried under some camping equipment and clothes that you culled from your closet but never got around to donating.

You have a spot on your kitchen counter where you toss the mail when you come in from work and the forgotten cable bill is at the bottom of the pile.

Get it together! Clean out one closet or drawer a week until the whole house is done. You’ll be amazed at what you find, what you can get rid of and how much lighter you feel once all that stuff is gone.

Set up automatic bill pay through your bank. If you don’t feel comfortable with that, at least set up an alert on your phone for a few days before a bill is due. A lot of billing dates can be changed too. Call up as many as you can and ask that the due dates be changed to the same day. If that will leave you with too little cash, change the dates to two different dates that coincide with when you get paid. There’s no reason you have to be paying bills every few days.</p>

      <section id="mag7" data-magellan-target="mag7">
        <STRONG><h1>7. YOU STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND</h1></STRONG>
        <p>This is no joke. It’s scary, I know it is. But I promise, you will feel better when you have a clearer picture of your situation. To drift is Hell, to steer, Heaven. You will feel better because you will be able to make a plan to fix this. And having a plan and taking action on it will give you relief.</p>
      </section>  

      <section id="mag8" data-magellan-target="mag8">
        <STRONG><h1>8. YOU SPEND WHAT YOU EXPECT TO MAKE</h1></STRONG>
        <p>Pretend that tomorrow may never come. Not in the sense that you won’t wake up. That will make you spend more money! But in the sense that you may not get a big raise at your next review or your company stock options may never be worth anything or gasp! that you may never actually win the lottery.

Spend based on what you make right now, not what you think you might make one day soon or worse, think that you rightly deserve.</p>
      </section>  

      <section id="mag9" data-magellan-target="mag9">
        <STRONG><h1>9. YOU'RE TOO CHEAP!</h1></STRONG>
        <p>Instead of being cheap, be frugal. A frugal person doesn’t always choose the cheapest option. When they decide to spend money, they choose the best option they can afford. If you need a new can opener, you don’t have to buy the diamond studded one, but you shouldn’t buy the one at the dollar store either because it won’t last.

      <section id="mag10" data-magellan-target="mag10">
        <STRONG><h1>10. YOU DRIVE EVERYWHERE</h1></STRONG>
        <p>I know not everyone has public transit or even sidewalks. But some of you who drive everywhere do. And some of you are capable of riding a bike. You don’t have to ride or walk everywhere or in terrible weather but you don’t have to drive everywhere either.

Make a list of all the trips you take in your car for one week. Now look at the list and see if there is even just one trip you could make on public transit or by walking or biking. Walking and biking are pleasurable. The really are. And if you are one of those people who claims you don’t have time to exercise, doing so can help you kill two birds at once.

        <section id="mag11" data-magellan-target="mag11">
        <STRONG><h1>11. YOU LOVE A GOOD SALE</h1></STRONG>
        <p>If you buy something for $3 that was reduced from $5 how much have you saved, $2? Maybe. Is that thing something you needed? If it was, you did indeed save $2. If it was something you didn’t need, how much did you save? Nothing, you saved nothing! You spent $5. 

A sale is like the Siren’s Song to some people and they will buy a thing that’s on sale no matter if they need it or not. Stop doing this. If there is a sale on something you use, by all means, stock up. But ask yourself if you do need it or if you just want that little charge of “saving money” or “getting a good deal.”</p>
      </section> 

       <section id="mag12" data-magellan-target="mag12">
        <STRONG><h1>12. YOU BUY AS NEEDED</h1></STRONG>
        <p>Buy in bulk! Poor people often can’t afford to do this. They only have the money to replace things when they run out completely. But you aren’t poor, you’re just broke. This is partly why. Buying one of something is usually more expensive than buying several of them.

My local drug store currently has a really cheap, gross, single ply brand of toilet roll on sale for .50 a roll. They have 12 rolls of really nice toilet roll on sale for $4.99. So the nicer one comes out to .42 per roll. You get a better product at a cheaper price when you buy in larger quantities.
</p></section>

<section id="mag13" data-magellan-target="mag13">
        <STRONG><h1>13. ALL OR NOTHING</h1></STRONG>
        <p>Perfect is not the enemy of good. You will mess up because we’re humans and not robots. It’s okay to mess up. What’s not okay is to mess up and then throw your hands up in defeat. You messed up today but you can and you will do better tomorrow.</p>
      </section> 

      <section id="mag14" data-magellan-target="mag14">
        <STRONG><h1>14. EMERGENCY FUND</h1></STRONG>
        <p>There are lots of lofty numbers to aspire to when saving for an emergency fund, three months of expenses, six months, $25,000. But you’re broke so those numbers are out of reach right now.

But remember, you are not poor. So you’re going to scrimp, save and cut back until you have $1000 to set aside as your emergency fund. That amount is not out of reach for a broke person, you just have to start doing a few of the fixes on this list that you haven’t been doing. You’ll have your emergency fund in no time so you can stop using your credit card for emergencies. Remember, debt is an emergency too.</p>
